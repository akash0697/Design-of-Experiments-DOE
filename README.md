# Design-of-Experiments-DOE
This repository contains a Design of Experiments (DOE) project conducted as part of Business Analytics(SCM 517). The objective was to design and optimize a Lego race car using statistical experiments to maximize the distance traveled. The project follows a structured approach, leveraging Minitab for data analysis and factorial design techniques.
